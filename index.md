Cauliflower is a solver-generator for CFL-R problems. Our aim is to provide a
high-performance tool for rapid-prototyping and embedded development of CFL-R
applications. Many modern software tools, including compiler optimisations, bug
checkers, and security verifiers, depend on CFL-R to solve their problems, but
there are no tools currently in existance (2016-11-07) specialised for CFL-R
problems.
