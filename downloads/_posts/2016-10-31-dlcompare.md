title: Experimental release: Datalog Comparison
layout: post
---

This is an experimental version of Cauliflower.
It is a historic snapshot from when the sequential solver was still available in the main Cauliflower branch.
Due to the limitations of a sequential solver, this work had to be suspended in favour of increased focus on parallel solvers.

The comparisons between Datalog and Cauliflower used this snapshot of the repository.
Most datalog tools only have a sequential solver, so comparing them with parallel versions of Cauliflower would be unreasonable.
